# Sortable

A simple sorting visualizer.

Will have support for all kinds of data, most notably .csv files and special encoded .txt files.
Shall feature a variety of common sorting algorithms, as well as a simple proprietary scripting language to add custom
sorting algorithms. 

Right now implemented features are:
<ul>
  <li> Basic visualization </li>
  <li> Basic visualization options </li>
  <li> Basic file reading (Only comma-seperated values at the moment) </li>
  <li> InsertionSort and MergeSort </li>
</ul>

More features will come in the near future
